            <h4>What does Veracity consider a source?</h4>
            <p>Veracity considers a source to be any origin of information that supports a claim. This includes news outlets, research papers, government reports, expert opinions, or documented content providing facts or insights.</p>
            <h4>How does Veracity curate the sources?</h4>
            <p>Veracity curates sources by evaluating their trustworthiness through key criteria: reputation, transparency, accuracy, and bias. It considers the sourceâ€™s track record, whether it cites verifiable evidence, and how consistently it presents factual information. This careful curation ensures that only reliable sources are used for scoring claims.</p>
